# User Stories – ALX Airbnb Project Documentation

## 📖 Overview

This section of the project documentation contains **User Stories** derived from the **Use Case Diagram**.

User stories translate the technical interactions into **simple, human-centered requirements**. They describe the system **from the perspective of the end users** and explain _why_ a feature is important.

Each story follows the classic template:

> **As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [reason/benefit].**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Translate use case interactions into human-readable requirements.
- Ensure the system meets the expectations of its users.
- Provide a foundation for development and testing.

---

## 📂 Structure

- `user-stories.md` → Contains all user stories for the core features.
- `README.md` → Provides context, objectives, and explains the purpose of the user stories.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Developers will use these user stories as a **guide for implementation**.
- QA/testers can use them as **acceptance criteria** to verify functionality.
- The documentation team will keep stories **updated** as the system evolves.
