# User Stories – ALX Airbnb Project Documentation

## 📌 Objective

The purpose of this task is to **convert the interactions captured in the Use Case Diagram** (from Task 1) into **user stories**.  
User stories help us translate abstract system interactions into **clear, human-centered requirements** that guide design and development.

---

## 🛠 Instructions Followed

1. Reviewed the **Use Case Diagram** designed in Task 1.
2. Identified all **key actors** and **core functionalities** such as:
   - User Registration & Authentication
   - Property Listing & Management
   - Property Search & Booking
   - Payment Processing
   - Review & Rating System
3. Converted each use case into **user stories**, written from the perspective of the actor (user, host, or admin).
4. Documented at least **5 detailed user stories** to reflect the main features of the system.
5. Created this file (`README.md`) to provide context, and a `user-stories.md` file to list the actual user stories.

## 🧾 Example of Conversion Process

- **Use Case (from diagram):** User Registration
- **Converted User Story:**  
  _"As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can securely log in and access Airbnb features."_

This ensures that every visual element in the diagram is mapped to a **real-world user goal**.

## ✅ Deliverables in This Directory

1. `user-stories.md`

   - Contains **5+ user stories** derived from the use case diagram.
   - Written in the format:
     ```
     As a <role>, I want <goal>, so that <benefit>.
     ```

2. `README.md` _(this file)_
   - Explains the objective, methodology, and repository organization for the **User Stories task**.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Use these **user stories** to refine functional requirements.
- Guide system design, database modeling, and feature prioritization.
- Validate user stories with stakeholders to ensure they align with **business goals** and **user needs**.
